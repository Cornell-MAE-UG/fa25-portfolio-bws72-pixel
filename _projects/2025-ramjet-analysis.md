A ramjet is a type of jet engine designed for high supersonic speeds. Similar to a subsonic turbojet, ramjets include a conbustor driven by a Brayton Cycle, followed by a nozzle that accelerates air out of the engine and produces thrust. However, ramjets differ from turbojets in that they do not include a compressor, nor a turbine to drive it, to compress inlet air. Instead, inlet air is compressed by a diffuser, taking advantage of the ram effect and the shockwave created by the engine hitting air at supersonic speeds to slow down and increase the pressure of inlet air. The drawback of this is that ramjets cannot operate nearly as efficiently at lower, subsonic speeds, like those present of takeoff and landing. Aircraft or missiles that use a ramjet engine must first be accelerated to supersonic speeds by a rocket or other propulsion system.

Section 5: Drawbacks and difficulties of ramjets


Talk about the Blackbird turbofan ramjet thingy, possibly the X-43, though this is a scramjet drone

Ramjets are generally the most fuel efficient between Mach 3 and 5. 


Hi there hello. We are gonna analyze a ramjet under mass, energy, and entropy balances using a control volume approach.
